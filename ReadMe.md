# Course: Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python (Udemy)

Hands on experience using Spark and PySpark to solve machine learning problems.

## Exercises
* Exercise 1 - Counts of Movie Ratings
  * Create a Spark connection; read data, format, count, print results
* Exercise 2 - Average Friends By Age
  * Store and transform data organized as tuples
* Exercise 3 - Filter Minimum and Maximum Temperature
  * Filter
* Exercise 4 - Word Counts
  * 4.1: Use flatMap to separate words from text and count frequency
  * 4.2: Define a function that converts to unicode, formats lower case
  * 4.3: Sort the results
* Exercise 5 - Popular Movies
  * 4.1: Use map, reduce and sort by key to return the most frequent movie ID
  * 4.2: Use a broadcast object to return the movie name in place of the movieID
* Exercise 6 - Most Popular Super Hero
  * Store name values to key-value Rdd instead of broadcast
* Exercise 7 - Super Hero Degress of Seperation
  * Use breadth-first-search
* Exercise 8 - Movie Similarity
  * 8.1: Use Cosine Similarity, score threshold of 0.97 and co-occurence threshold 50
  * 8.2: 8.1 + Discard bad movies (median ratings <= 2)
